<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dr-jessica-mason">Dr Jessica Mason</h3>
<p>Jessica Zamborain Mason is an interdisciplinary quantitative marine scientist who aims to contribute towards achieving ecologic, social and economic sustainability in the world’s fisheries. Jessica’s research combines statistical and mechanistic models with empirical observational data to increase our understanding of human-environment interactions, the performance of natural resources, and inform resource management and policy. Her interests span two major overarching themes. First, as a way to identify the best context-specific pathways to manage fisheries, she is interested in developing sustainable reference points and assessing fisheries from multiple socio-ecological dimensions. Secondly, Jessica is interested in examining how natural resources, sustainable reference points, and the effective management of resources vary with ongoing environmental and socio-economic change.<br>
</p>
<p>Jessica completed her PhD at James Cook University and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef studies (Australia) in 2021. During her PhD, she took a long-term fisheries production and ecosystem function lens, estimating sustainable reference points and assessing the status of multispecies coral reef fisheries at global and local scales. Currently, Jessica is a postdoctoral research associate in the Departments of Nutrition and Environmental Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Jessica’s current research takes a nutritional lens to fisheries, integrating nutritional outcomes into fisheries reference points, increasing our understanding on the nutritional contributions fo aquatic foods, and examining the consequences of climate change, human use and management on natural resources, human nutrition and public health. Overall, she aims to improve our understanding on nutrition-sensitive approaches to fisheries management and policy.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dr-kathryn-fiorella">Dr Kathryn Fiorella</h3>
<p>I am an environmental scientist and epidemiologist, and my research aims to understand the interactions among environmental change and livelihood, food, and nutrition security. My work is focused on global fisheries and the households that are reliant on the environment to access food and income. I use interdisciplinary methods and my work aims to foster a deeper understanding of how ecological and social systems interact, the ways communities and households adapt to and mitigate environmental change, and the links between human well being and ecological sustainability.</p>
<p>My work has been funded by NSF, USAID, National Geographic and more, and I have published more than 55 peer-reviewed journal articles. I am a co-editor of the book, <em>Foundations of Socio-Environmental Research: Legacy Readings with Commentaries,</em> which is an anthology of 53 foundational readings tracing the history of socio-environmental research from the late 1700s onward.</p>
<p>I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Public and Ecosystem Health at Cornell University, and I lead the Food Systems and Health Concentration area of the Master of Public Health Program. I am the faculty director of the Migrations Program in the Einaudi Center; a Faculty Fellow of the K. Lisa Yang Center for Wildlife Health, Cornell Atkinson Center and the Center for Health Equity; and a core faculty member of the Southeast Asia Program. I hold a PhD in Environmental Science, Policy &amp; Management and a Master of Public Health from the University of California, Berkeley, and an AB in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ms-lydia-omeara">Ms Lydia O’Meara</h3>
<p>Originally from a sheep station in outback Australia, Lydia is a nutritionist, specialising in sustainable food systems for nutrient adequacy of vulnerable groups. She has 6 years of research experience in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia-Pacific, focusing on small scale fisheries in the African Great Lakes Region, Mekong River Delta, and Pacific Islands. She is currently a PhD scholar with the Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich UK and lead FAO consultant on the Timor-Leste National Fish Consumption Survey.</p>
<p>Given the global paucity of disaggregated aquatic food consumption data, limiting analysis of the aquatic food-nutrition-environmental nexus; Lydia has a strong interest in refining dietary data collection methods to improve data quality of fish consumption using innovative tools such as photographic visual aids to identify species and quantify amount eaten. As a part of her PhD, she is analysing the contribution of aquatic foods to the micronutrient adequacy of women living nearby fisheries in rural Uganda using weighed food records. She is also validating a novel method using mobile phones to remotely monitor dietary quality and fish consumption of hard-to-reach fisheries-dependent households during the wet season when roads become impassable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In her work with WorldFish and FAO, Lydia contributed to the FAO report “Illuminating Hidden Harvests: the contribution of small-scale fisheries to global food and nutrition security”, helped integrate small fish into the National Feeding Programme in Odisha, India, and was lead author on the FAO report “Pacific food systems: the role of fish and aquatic foods for nutrition and health” for the UN Food Systems Summit.</p>

<p>Kjellevold is a nutritionist at the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) in Bergen, Norway. Her expertise centers on food security and nutrition, with a particular emphasis on the role of aquatic foods as a sustainable, food-based strategy to address micronutrient deficiencies.</p>
<p>Aquatic food is not well integrated into efforts to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of “zero hunger” (SDG 2) and “good health and well-being” (SDG 3). Dr.&nbsp;Kjellevold’s research, emphasizes how SDG 14 (Life Below Water) can enhance nutrition security in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia, as well as in high-income countries like Norway.</p>
<p>Since 2018, Dr.&nbsp;Kjellevold has led the “Nutrition and Food Safety” science theme within the EAF Nansen Programme, a longstanding partnership between the FAO and Norway, implemented in close collaboration with the IMR. Through the EAF Nansen Programme and various research initiatives, Dr.&nbsp;Kjellevold has focused on generating high-quality analytical data on aquatic foods across Africa and Asia. Her research spans both raw and processed species from marine and freshwater resources. Additionally, she has played a role in developing the Aquatic Food Composition Database at Harvard and has contributed to the IMR Seafood Database.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Kjellevold has authored or co-authored approximately 110 peer-reviewed journal articles across several fields: nutritional epidemiology, food composition and analysis, dietary assessment, food safety, and food and nutrition security. She has also delivered numerous scientific presentations, spoken at various conferences, and written popular articles on these topics.</p>

<p>Research Professor Maria Wik Markhus is a nutritionist at the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) in Bergen, Norway, specializing in food security and nutrition. She holds a PhD in nutrition science and has dedicated her career to understanding the connections between diet, health, and the environment, with a particular focus on the role of aquatic foods in addressing micronutrient deficiencies.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Markhus’s research highlights the nutritional benefits of aquatic foods, especially their richness in omega-3 fatty acids and essential micronutrients. Her work emphasizes the potential of sustainable aquatic food systems to combat malnutrition and improve global health. She has published over 40 peer-reviewed articles on topics ranging from the nutritional value of aquatic foods to micronutrient status in populations and the development of sustainable food practices.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Markhus works with policymakers, international organizations, and research institutions to promote evidence-based solutions for the importance of aquatic foods for food security and nutrition. She is a frequent contributor to both UN and scientific international conferences on nutrition, food systems, and sustainability. In addition to her research, Dr.&nbsp;Markhus leads the secretariat of the Global Action Network for Sustainable Food from the Oceans and Inland Waters for Food Security and Nutrition, a government lead initiative by Norway. Through her leadership, she organizes events to advance sustainable aquatic food practices and improve food security for all. Her work continues to shape global efforts to use aquatic foods as an important part of the solution for improving nutrition and health, particularly in vulnerable populations</p>
